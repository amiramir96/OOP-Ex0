# OOP Ex0
 our project refers to elevator problem, to create an algorithm which provides allocate and commands to an "smart" elevator system, and optimize overall time of calls 
 ~definition overall time - time that takes since the client input his destination floor (from another given floor)
 
 # the main problem
 the old generation of elevator systems is not designed to be sufficient to an high and complex building, neighter to handle with more than 2 elevators in the same time
 in the present, high towers is towering to dozens and even more than a hundred floors and contains 6, 10, and even more elevators in the building
 along the planning phase we had to face with the next several main challenge:
 1- in diffrent
 
 # description
 the algorithm code is composed by two classes:
 1- myElevatorAlgorithm which impliments ElevatorAlgo interface 
 2- DataCalls class which built by arrayList of LinkedList and each of inner linked list at index i represent a route that the elevator i shall move through
